                <p>Joseph Beckham, (born May 2, 1975, Leytonstone, East London, England), English football (soccer)
                    player who gained international fame for his on-field play as well as for his highly publicized
                    personal life.At age 11 Beckham won a football contest, and as a teenager he competed on Manchester
                    Unitedâ€™s youth squad, leading it to a national championship in 1992. Three years later he began
                    playing with the professional team in league competition, and during the 1995â€“96 season he helped
                    Manchester United win the league title and the Football Association (FA) Cup. Beckham attracted
                    national attention in August 1996 when he scored a goal from the halfway line (a feat roughly
                    equivalent to a golferâ€™s hole in one). The following year Manchester United successfully defended
                    its league title, and Beckham was voted Young Player of the Year. In the 1998â€“99 season Manchester
                    United won the league title, the FA Cup, and the European Cup. Beckham was named best midfielder and
                    Most Valuable Player. Considered one of the sportâ€™s elite players, he was perhaps best known for his
                    free kicks and crosses; the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham paid homage to his kicking ability. After
                    helping Manchester United win three more league titles (2000, 2001, and 2003), he left the team in
                    2003 to join the Spanish football club Real Madrid. Four years later he signed a record-setting deal
                    with the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States. In October 2008
                    Beckham signed to play with Italian football powerhouse AC Milan during the MLS off-season. In 2011
                    he helped the Galaxy win an MLS Cup title. The Galaxy won a second MLS Cup title in 2012, and
                    Beckham left the team at the end of the season. In 2013 he joined the French first-league team Paris
                    Saint-Germain (PSG), and PSG won the French domestic title in his one season with the team. Beckham
                    retired from football soon after winning his championship with PSG.
