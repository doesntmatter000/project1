                        <p>First of all i hate this website before even i started hit to build, to be clear i will start with 3 months ago when my friend asked me to join in his team of C++ (competition) so i was agree cause he said to me i dont need to learn anything just to go with him and to looks like i know all about that c++ , but i started to learn cause its not normal to just stay with him and win some prizes (but the real  is because im stupid) moreover i used to like this programing,another moment is that competition was divided in two parts first website and secon c++ where i was . so all participant of school were in both phases and ofcourse not me , at the end my teacher for all my schoolmates gave a favour {of course its not was a favour i just cant find a better word cause my english is **** at the moment, and not for all but that doesnt matter} 10 instead of finall project of the year and that project is that website that you are reading right now , but not for me cause i participated only in second phase and im completely disagree cause learn preety much .At the end im not angry that i participated in that competicion moreover im very happy but life its not faire cause instead of pass to made this website i got a 10 mark that i hate him with all my heart cause it doesnt worth me even 5 banuti.</p>
